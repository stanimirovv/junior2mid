# Overview

One of the unique aspects in our field of work is that constantly learning isn't recommended, it is a must have. Of course you will never master everything, but the good news is that certain principles - the foundation is the same.&#x20;

A lot of the innovations are rehashed old concepts.&#x20;

The bad news is that people forget and as you learn new things this changes your perception of old things - often rereading a book will be more valuable than the initial read!

To make things even harder you will have to do most of your learning outside of work hours - investing your personal time. Maybe now it's starting to be clear why there is always a shortage of IT people :P

As long as you do it regularly you don't need to invest that much time. I won't dare to put an estimate - it really depends on the individual, but if you are sacrificing your social/personal life to study you are doing something wrong. If you can't remember what was the last thing you were learning - it's definitely something to improve on.

The most important thing is to do it regularly even if it's for a short amount of time. You will be surprised what 20-30 minutes of concentrated work can do when they start stacking up.

**Before we move on to the topics there are a few general guidelines I'd like to give on how to approach learning:**

* Try to be as rested as possible. If it is after work, make a short break before learning. Ideally do it before work
* Do not change topics often. Since most likely you will be learning at short intervals do not mix things up. Dedicate a week or a month on a topic, then move on
* Doing things regularly is more important than having large chunks of time
* &#x20;Keep yourself accountable - try not to be distracted, even if it is for 20 minutes at a time, do just that
* Don't get overconfident, challenge your understanding

With that out of the way, let's dive into the topics!
