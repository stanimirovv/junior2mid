# Overview

One of the unique aspects of our field of work is that constantly learning is not just recommended, it is a must-have. Of course, it's impossible to master everything, but the good news is that many innovations are based on rehashed old concepts, and the foundation remains the same.&#x20;

The bad news is that people often forget what they've learned, and as you learn new things, your perception of old things changes. Rereading a book can be more valuable than the initial read! To make things even harder, you will have to do most of your learning outside of work hours, investing your personal time. It's starting to become clear why there is always a shortage of IT professionals.

As long as you learn regularly, you don't need to invest a significant amount of time. It's difficult to estimate how much time each person needs, but sacrificing your social or personal life to study is not the right approach.&#x20;

If you can't remember what you were last learning, it's definitely something to improve on.&#x20;

The most important thing is to **learn regularly**, even if it's only for a short amount of time. You'll be surprised how much 20-30 minutes of concentrated work can achieve when they start stacking up.

Before we move on to the topics, here are a few general guidelines for approaching learning:

* Try to be well-rested before learning. If it's after work, take a short break before studying. Ideally, study before work.
* Don't change topics too often. Since you're likely to be learning in short intervals, don't mix things up. Dedicate a week or a month to a topic before moving on.
* Regular study is more important than having large chunks of time.
* Keep yourself accountable and avoid distractions, even if you're only studying for 20 minutes at a time.
* Challenge your understanding and avoid overconfidence.

With that out of the way, let's dive into the topics!
