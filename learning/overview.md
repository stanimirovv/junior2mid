# Overview

One of the unique aspects in our field of work is that constantly learning isn't recommended, it is a must have. Of course you will never master everything, but the good news is that certain principles - the foundation is the same. A lot of the innovations are rehashed old concepts. The bad news is that people forget and as you learn new things this changes your perception of old things - often rereading a book will be more valuable than the initial read!

To make things even harder you will have to do most of your learning outside of work hours - investing your personal time. Maybe now it's starting to be clear why there is always a shortage of IT people :P

As long as you do it regularly you don't need to invest that much time. I won't dare to put an estimate - it really depends on the individual, but if you are sacrificing your social/personal life to study you are doing something wrong. If you can't remember what was the last thing you were learning - it's definitely something to improve on.

The most important thing is to do it regularly even if it's for a short amount of time. You will be surprised what 20-30 minutes of concentrated work can do when they start stacking up.
