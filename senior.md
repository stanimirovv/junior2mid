# Senior

A senior developer has accumulated more technical knowledge, learning experience, and soft skills than a mid-level developer. In addition to the technical skills required for mid-level developers, senior developers should also have:

* Knowledge of multiple third-party libraries.
* A wealth of solutions for various errors encountered before.
* A dedication to writing clear and clean code, using patterns, and being able to understand the connections between system components.
* A dedication to bringing business value and doing what it takes to make the project successful

Learning at this stage is vastly improved as previous experience serves as a strong foundation for learning new technologies. Senior developers tend to avoid bandwagon thinking and are more thoughtful about spreading knowledge to their colleagues. They embrace code quality tools like auto-formatters and linters and gain more knowledge about the bigger picture, such as the differences between MVC and CQRS approaches in structuring an app.

Soft skills also receive a bump up. Senior developers prioritize self-care to prevent burnout and have a more relaxed attitude and improved approachability. They offer smarter suggestions on different approaches to solving problems.

While being a junior and meriod developer you are a focusing on becomming a feature machine and learning how to code properlly when you are a senior you shift to balancing the development speed and quality. You need to understand the neuances, the scope and type of project so you can set the correct foundations and deliver business value in a lean manner.

In short, senior developers can handle any task thrown at them and help shape the implementation of the project. They have a deep understanding of the software development process and can provide guidance to their colleagues while maintaining a high level of technical expertise.
