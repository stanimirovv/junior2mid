# Senior

Senior has accumulated more technical knowledge, learning experience and soft skills so now his technical knowledge should contain:

* Knowledge of multiple 3rd party libraries
* Accumulation of solutions for various errors encountered before
* Usage of patterns / dedication to writing clear and clean code
* Ability to easily understand the connections between system components
* Solutions to common tasks are uneventful

Learning at this stage:

* Is vastly improved as previous experience is strong foundation for learning new techs
* There is less bandwagon thinking about technologies and accepting the hype
* More thought is given on how to spreading the knowledge to other colleagues
* Embracing code quality tools like auto formatters, linters
* More knowledge is gained about bigger picture, ie MVC vs CQRS approaches in structuring the app

Soft skills also get a bump up:

* The self care gets a priority to prevent burnout
* Relaxed attitude and improved approachability
* Smarter suggestions on different approaches to solving the problems

In short, senior can handle any task thrown at them, can help shape the implementation of the project
