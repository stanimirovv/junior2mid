# Senior

Senior has accumulated more technical knowledge, learning experience and soft skills, so now his technical knowledge should contain:

* Knowledge of multiple 3rd party libraries
* Accumulation of solutions for various errors encountered before
* Usage of patterns/dedication to writing clear and clean code
* Ability to easily understand the connections between system components
* Solutions to common tasks are uneventful.

Learning at this stage:

* Is vastly improved as previous experience is a strong foundation for learning new techs
* There is less bandwagon thinking about technologies and accepting the hype
* More thought is given to how to spread the knowledge to other colleagues
* Embracing code quality tools like auto-formatters and linters
* More knowledge is gained about the bigger picture, i.e. MVC vs CQRS approaches in structuring the app

Soft skills also get a bump up:

* The self-care gets a priority to prevent burnout
* Relaxed attitude and improved approachability
* Smarter suggestions on different approaches to solving the problems.

In short, seniors can handle any task thrown at them and help to shape the implementation of the project.
