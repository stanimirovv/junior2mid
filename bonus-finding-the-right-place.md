# Bonus: Finding the right place

The ideal place will allow you to grow. The company should challenge you to step up and to improve. It should allow you to take charge on certain initiatives and eventually take ownership of part of the system.

Being in the right place will boost your career. Being in the wrong place will keep you stagnated, possibly even burn you out.

Choose wisely and join an organization that will help you grow.
