# Medior

Medior seniority requires more technical knowledge than junior, so in addition to junior tech skills, a medior should be familiar with:

* Advanced language features
* Performance evaluation of the code (i.e. don’t pull 1 million records from a DB into memory)
* Conscious usage of programming patterns (i.e. “I could use a singleton here instead of normal class”)
* Additional (limited) knowledge about the most used services, like Redis, Elasticsearch, Kafka, or other commonly used 3rd party libraries
* More knowledge about the software ecosystem and general scope
* Errors are not an afterthought anymore
* Errors messages are important information now.

****

Learning capabilities are improved, and now acquiring new skills takes less time. Soft skills are also further improved from the junior level:

* Much better forethought about the possible solutions
* Better at estimating the difficulty of assigned tasks
* Better at predicting the blanks in requirements
* Better balance in asking for help.

In short, medior can handle tasks independently, begins to look into other areas of development and think about the bigger picture.
