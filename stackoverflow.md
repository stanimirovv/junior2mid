# StackOverflow

StackOverflow is a great resource - its answers are updated and maintained by the community. Some of the answers are quite large and give great insights.

I have a few guidelines about StackOverflow:

1. Read only accepted answers as they are the maintained ones.
2. Search before asking.
3. Don't overuse it, your end goal should be to use the official documentation.

Keep in mind that StackOverflow is not for learning, it is for finding answers to specific questions. Donâ€™t fall into the trap of abusing StackOverflow since sooner or later you must stop depending on it.
