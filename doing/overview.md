# Overview

Learning is important, but it is equally important to apply what you learn through practice. You may forget what you have learned or build your knowledge on an incorrect foundation if you do not practice enough. Fortunately, most of these practices can be applied on company time as they are a part of your job.

For personal time, reading can be more beneficial. Spend around 25 minutes reading about a topic and allocate 15 minutes to quickly verify the things that you find confusing or uncertain. Trusting your instincts about things that you don't understand is crucial when it comes to learning.

However, as humans, we tend to do examples with what we understand rather than what we don't understand. Therefore, it is essential to incorporate as many practices as possible into your daily job routine, as it will save you time and enhance your professional skills.

While the previous section included specific books, topics, and technologies that are the de facto standards and must-knows, in the doing, we are entering unclear waters. Things will become much more technology-specific, so it is better to stick to the principles.

In order to find resources that are technology-specific, you need to learn how to filter out good resources from the bad ones. This will help you make the best use of your time and ensure that you are learning the right things. Look for resources specific to the technology or programming language you are working with, as it will be more relevant to your work.
