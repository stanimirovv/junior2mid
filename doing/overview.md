# Overview

Doing is just as important as learning. No matter how much you learn you will quickly forget things and build your knowledge base on a wrong foundation unless you practice, practice, practice. The good news is that most of these things you can do on company time as they are part of your job.

For your personal time I would recommend leaning a bit towards the reading. If you have, let's say 40 minutes, spend 25 of them reading on a topic and 15 to quickly verify the things that made you feel uncomfortable or uncertain. Following your gut about things you don't understand is quite important when learning.

Unfortunately as people we tend to do examples with what we understand - not what we don't understand. The ratio is up to you but, try to incorporate as many of the practices as you can in your day job. It will both save you time and improve your skills as a professional.

The previous section had some specific books/topics/technologies that are a defacto standard and you must know. In the doing, we are entering unclear waters - things will be a lot more technology specific so we will stick just to the principles.&#x20;

Finding resources should still be easy (at this point you have started learning how to filter out good resources from bad ones, right ?), but technology specific.
