# Developer seniority

Developer seniority often comes up in development talks, but there is rarely a complete agreement about the differentiation. This topic is very subjective, and often multiple forces influence what each level represents. Sometimes developers say what they want to hear, sometimes outsourcing businesses promote their developers to set better prices, sometimes developers are promoted to the next level because of years spent in the company.

The following is a personal opinion on seniority levels and what programmers of each level need.

We can divide developer seniority into multiple levels where each level defines the developer by a combination of programming skills, learning capabilities and soft skills. The four main levels we have for seniority are:

* Junior
* Medior
* Senior
* Super senior (SS).

Roles are often confused with seniority because they are sometimes linked together. Backend developer, frontend developer and software architect are examples of such roles. Some of them, like software architects, require advanced development knowledge but do not represent seniority. For example, a Senior (not an SS) can be a Software Architect, but that doesnâ€™t elevate him to a SS level.

So, to repeat - seniority levels should only be influenced by programming skills, learning capability and soft skills. Now let us see what each seniority level represents.
