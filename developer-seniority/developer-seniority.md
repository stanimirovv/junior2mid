# Developer seniority

Developer seniority is often mentioned in development talks, but there is rarely a complete agreement on it.This topic is very subjective and often there are multiple forces that influence what each level represents. Sometimes, developers say what they would like to hear, sometimes outsourcing business promotes the developers to get better prices, other times it’s the years spent at the company that will promote the developer to the next level.

What follows is a personal opinion on the seniority levels and what each level requires.

We can divide the developer seniority in multiple levels where each level defines developer by effective programming skills + the learning capabilities + the soft skills. The four main levels we have for seniority would be:

* Junior
* Medior
* Senior
* Super senior (SS)

Roles are often confused with seniority because they are sometimes linked together. Backend Developer, Frontend Developer, Software Architect, etc. are examples of roles. Some roles like software architect, require development knowledge but they don't represent seniority. For example a Senior (not SS) can have a Software Architect role but that doesn’t make him SS level.

So to repeat - the seniority levels should be influenced only by the programming skills, learning capability, and the soft skills. Now lets see what each seniority level represents.
