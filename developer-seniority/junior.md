# Junior

Junior developer is an entry-level position, but this seniority level still requires certain skills and knowledge. The technical skills required from a junior-level developer should include:

* Knowledge of at least one programming language and the ability to solve 6th kyu rank tasks on [www.codewars.com](http://www.codewars.com/) in a reasonable time. This means having usable knowledge of language features like variables, loops, branching, and most common functions for standard data types.
* Depending on the area of expertise (backend or frontend), familiarity with basic functionalities that are a part of the usual software. For example, in the backend area, this includes knowledge of how to create entities, query a database, etc.
* Familiarity with basic Git commands or some other version control system.

Learning capabilities of junior developers:

* Learning new concepts and skills takes time as there are many unknown terms and concepts to process.
* Junior developers often rely heavily on Q\&A sites for resolving concrete problems and avoiding "overwhelming" documentation.

Soft skills required for a junior developer, along with some common observations about junior developers:

* Ability to understand the requirements of tasks.
* Requires guidance from colleagues to determine the correct approach to solving problems.
* One common issue is going to extremes when they require help. The first extreme is when a developer takes a long time to ask for help (something like after three days of trying); the other extreme is when a developer asks for help every time they encounter an issue.
* Another common issue is a lack of forethought about the solution. Usually, implementation is done in the "what I already know" way even if it is not optimal.
* Difficulties in filling in the gaps of requirements.

In short, junior seniority represents someone who needs guidance or supervision for performing day-to-day tasks and still has room for improvement in learning capability and/or soft skills.

To summarize, a junior developer is an entry-level position that requires a basic level of technical skills, including knowledge of at least one programming language and basic Git commands, as well as familiarity with basic functionalities depending on their area of expertise.&#x20;

Junior developers often rely on Q\&A sites for problem-solving and require guidance from colleagues to determine the correct approach to solving tasks. They may have difficulty filling in the gaps of requirements and lack forethought about the solution. However, with time and experience, junior developers can improve their learning capabilities and soft skills to become more independent in performing their day-to-day tasks.
