# Junior

Junior developer is a starting position but this seniority level doesn’t have zero requirements. Tech skills required for the junior level must include:

* Knowledge of at least one programming language and ability to solve 6th kyu rank of tasks on [www.codewars.com](http://www.codewars.com) in reasonable time. This means to have a usable knowledge of language features like variables, loops, branching, basic functions for standard data types
* Depending on the area of the development (backend/frontend) to be acquainted with basic functionalities that are part of usual software. For example in the backend area this includes how to create entities; how to query a database, etc...
* Git or some other version of source code management tool

Learning capability of junior developers:

* Learning new stuff takes a while as there are still may unknown terms and processing it takes considerable time
* Heavily depends Q\&A sites for resolving concrete problems and avoidance of “overwhelming” documentation

Junior developers will show some bad traits in soft skills which are improved with time and experience. Required soft skills for developer along with some usually observed traits:

* Requires ability to understand the requirements of tasks
* Requires a bit of guidance from the colleagues to determine the correct approach on solving
* One bad trait is going to extremes when they require help. First extreme is when the developer takes a long time to ask for help (something like after three days of trying); and the other extreme is when a developer asks every time they encounter an issue
* Another bad trait is lack of forethought about the solution. Usually implementation is done in “what I already know” way even if it is not optimal
* Difficulties in filling in the blanks of requirements

In short, junior seniority represents someone who needs guidance or supervision for performing the day to day tasks and still has room for improvement in learning capability and/or soft skills.
