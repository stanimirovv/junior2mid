# Junior

Junior developer is a starting position, but this seniority level doesn’t have zero requirements. Tech skills required from a junior-level developer must include:

* Knowledge of at least one programming language and ability to solve 6th kyu rank of tasks on [www.codewars.com](http://www.codewars.com) in a reasonable time. It means having usable knowledge of language features like variables, loops, branching and most common functions for standard data types
* Depending on the area of expertise (backend or frontend), be acquainted with basic functionalities that are a part of the usual software. For example, in the backend area, this includes knowledge on how to create entities, query a database, etc.
* Familiarity with basic Git commands or some other version of source code management tool

Learning capability of junior developers:

* Learning new stuff takes a while as there are still many unknown terms processing which takes considerable time
* Heavily depends on Q\&A sites for resolving concrete problems and avoidance of “overwhelming” documentation

Junior developers will show some bad traits in soft skills that will improve with time and experience. Required soft skills for developer along with some usually observed traits:

* Requires ability to understand the requirements of tasks
* Requires a bit of guidance from colleagues to determine the correct approach to solving
* One poor trait is going to extremes when they require help. The first extreme is when a developer takes a long time to ask for help (something like after three days of trying); the other extreme is when a developer asks every time they encounter an issue
* Another poor trait is a lack of forethought about the solution. Usually, implementation is done in the “what I already know” way even if it is not optimal
* Difficulties in filling in the blanks of requirements.

In short, junior seniority represents someone who needs guidance or supervision for performing the day-to-day tasks and still has room for improvement in learning capability and/or soft skills.
