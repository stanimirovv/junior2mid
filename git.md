# Git

Git is the de facto standard for version control systems. You will meet it and you, just like every developer who ever lived will struggle with it.

The most common mistake weâ€™'ve observed is that people stop learning about git after learning how to create a branch, commit, push and merge. There is a lot more to git. Most time is lost when you encounter merge or rebase conflicts.

Most people freeze and stop learning. Don't do that. Create an example project and setup. Break things. Figure out how to fix them and learn. Iterate over this until you feel comfortable with merge conflicts. The few hours you will spend playing around and breaking things will pay their weight in gold. Also find some great tools to help you better visualize merge - JetBrains tools like WebStorm make merges very easy.

This is a great resource than can get you started with git branching: https://learngitbranching.js.org/&#x20;

And this resource will get you started with resolving merge conflicts: https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line
