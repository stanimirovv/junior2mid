# Receiving feedback

When you receive feedback, always be polite and assume it is based on good intentions. If people don't care they wouldn't bother providing feedback.

Write it down and if you have questions feel free to follow up.

Do not argue with people. If you hear something you don't like, ask for an example and, again, assume good intentions. Even if you disagree, the issue can be resolved by the tech lead.

Make sure to take a breather before reviewing your feedback. Avoid being emotional and think about how you can use this to become better. Do not get discouraged if the feedback is mostly things you can improve. Be happy that you know what it is, knowing what you need to learn is half the battle.
