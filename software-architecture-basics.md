# Software Architecture Basics

Architecture takes a long time to learn so best start early. It is a combination of how modules are formed, how they communicate, how they don't communicate, how the responsibilities in the system(s) are split, etc. This is the code architecture.

There are other types of architecture, like deployment architecture - even though you may have a single app it can be deployed to several nodes behind a load balancer for example. You don't need to concern yourself with them until you have grasped the basics of code level architecture. As a junior chances are architecture is out of your scope for now.

There is a lot of good literature on the matter and when you are beginning any decent resource will get you started. If you are looking for a concrete recommendation a safe bet is Clean Architecture.

Architecture is one of the things that unfortunately greatly depends on your domain and scale of your app.

With that in mind when you do your research make sure to look for articles and books specific to your domain and usecase. Architecture that works for embedded software won't work for cloud and vice versa.
