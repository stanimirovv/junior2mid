# Super Senior (SS)

Not all seniors advance to this role but these are the traits that correspond to this SS seniority.



Technical knowledge:

* Multiple projects finished in different languages bring new perspective and insights into various ways of solving the problems
* Knowing when NOT to use patterns and stray from the general guidelines
* Getting back to basics; readability and changeability of the codebase is top priority
* Stopping over-engineering solutions when simple ones can suffice
* Excellent error handling and logging
* Superb knowledge of all application processes (CI/CD pipelines, web server configurations, 3rd party services configurations, deployments, â€¦)



Learning skills are top level:

* New techs can be acquired in very short time at an adequate level
* In depth evaluation of new trends and quick reasoning of pros/cons
* Consistency in learning and evaluating new technologies (not only for the job specific tech)

Soft skills are top notch:

* Bringing the most value to customer/product in limited resources vs making everything perfect (it never is :D)
* Speak openly about the issues, pros and cons of solutions
* Empowering learning within a team by carefully introducing new technologies that superseded existing tech
* Delegation of tasks and responsibilities to team members (ie. leave some core functionality to the other seniors on the team, to free yourself for unexpected events)
