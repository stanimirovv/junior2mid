# Adequately Asking For Help

There will be a lot of times you want help.

The best way to make sure that you will recieve help is to make it easy for people to help you.

What does that mean?

You want to provide context. Read your message and imagine you have absolutely no idea about the project or the feature. All the information you will have is based on that message.

This may sound too abstract, let me give you an example of how not to ask for help: "Hey I am getting an error when I login".

There is no information about the type of error or means to replicate it, making the helper unable to provide any help. This will lead to the helper requiring new information by starting a chat thread, or even worse a meeting. Remember - providing enough context is a requirement if you want your problem solved.
