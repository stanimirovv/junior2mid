# Bash Basics

Bash is the de facto standard for shells. On Mac you are equipped with zsh which is a superset of bash. You don't need to be an expert, but you need to learn it.

Why is it useful?

* A lot of times this is the only interface you will get when you are working with remote systems
* You can automate good chunks of your repeatable tasks
* You can manage processes and environments faster
* New features come first to the command line interface

You will know that you are good enough (for now :)) with bash when you have automated via aliases, cronjobs or a script at least one common task you are currently doing.
