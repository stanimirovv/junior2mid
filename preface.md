# Preface

This book will help you reach the next level of your career faster. It contains practical principles which are, for the most part, technology-agnostic. Regardless if you are a frontend, backend, mobile, embedded or machine learning developer, you will still be able to apply them.

Study these principles, apply them, and you will drastically shorten your path from a junior to a mid-level software developer. If you are already a medior, this book will likely still help you to assess yourself or fill in some gaps.

A part of your journey to being a mid-level developer is to learn to work with documentation and efficiently search for information. Since this book practices what it preaches, it will mostly mark the topics along with their core message. It is up to you to dive deeper into those topics and apply them to your specific case.

This book consists of three main parts:

* Learning - different topics that you must learn. This part ends with some specific technologies that you must get familiar with that are an integral part of modern software development and are domain-agnostic
* Doing - skills that you must practice during your workday - how to get better at debugging, how to make sure that you introduce fewer bugs
* Communicating - how to make sure you communicate your intentions clearly and how to make it easy to mentor you.
