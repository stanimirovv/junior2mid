# Preface



This book is going to help you get to the next level of your career faster.

It contains practical principles which are, for the most part, technology agnostic. Regardless if you are a frontend, backend, mobile, embedded or machine learning developer you will still be able to apply them.

Study these principles, apply them and you will drastically shorten your path from a junior to mid level software developer. If you are a Mid chances are this book will still be very useful to you. You can either use it to assess yourself or to fill in some gaps.

Part of your journey to a mid level developer is to learn how to effectively search for information and work with documentation.Since this book practices what it preaches it will mostly mark the topics along with their core message.It is up to you to dive deeper into those topics and apply them to your specific case.

This book is written with the intent to be short - you should focus on acquiring the skills, not on reading what you need to learn. Even though the chapters are short the guidance, principles and best practices are concentrated.

This book is structured into 3 main parts:

* Learning - different topics that you must learn and invest time in. This part finishes with some specific technologies that you must get familiar with that are integral part of modern software development and are domain agnostic.
* Doing - skills that you must practice during your workday - how to get better at debugging, how to make sure that you introduce less bugs.
* Communicating - how to make sure you communicate your intentions clearly and how to make yourself easy to mentor.
