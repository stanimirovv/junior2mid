# Asking for feedback

Make sure you ask for feedback on your work periodically.

In a lot of companies you will have 1:1 calls with your manager but that is not enough. It is important you are proactive since feedback will shorten your journey to the next level of your career.

When you complete a feature, or once every 2-3 months make sure to reach out to the people you've worked with. Ask your seniors for feedback on what you did well and what you can improve on and donâ€™t forget your peers - often they will have the best insight.
