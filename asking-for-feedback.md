# Asking and recieving feedback

As a junior developer, it is crucial to seek feedback on your work regularly. While feedback can be difficult to hear, it is an essential tool for growth and development. Seeking feedback from senior team members and peers will give you valuable insights into your strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement.

You may feel that you lack the experience and knowledge to ask for feedback confidently. However, asking for feedback demonstrates that you are committed to improving and learning. It shows that you value the input of others and are willing to take constructive criticism to become a better developer.

When seeking feedback, make sure to be specific about what you want feedback on. For example, if you are working on a new feature, ask for feedback on the code structure, user experience, or design. Being specific will help the person providing feedback to give more detailed and targeted feedback, making it more actionable for you.

It is also important to be open-minded when receiving feedback. As a junior developer, you may feel defensive or unsure of yourself when receiving criticism. However, remember that feedback is an opportunity to learn and improve. Acknowledge the feedback, ask questions if needed, and take the time to reflect on it. Remember, the person providing feedback is trying to help you grow, not criticize you.

In addition to seeking feedback from your immediate team, it is helpful to seek feedback from people with different perspectives and experiences. This could include people outside your department or even outside your organization. Seeking feedback from diverse sources can provide fresh insights and help you develop new skills.

After receiving feedback, create an action plan to implement the changes suggested. Follow up with the person who provided feedback to show that you have taken their comments seriously. By taking action on the feedback, you are demonstrating that you are committed to growth and development.
