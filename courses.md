# Courses

Ratings and reviews are important, but they don't cover everything.

1. When was the course updated last? If you are interested in the latest version/current best practices this is important.
2. When you google the course are there strongly negative recent reviews in 3rd party places, for example reddit?
3. Does the course length fit your expectations? I've seen courses on the same topic varying from 8 to 100 hours. The one worth 100 hours weren't 12 times better, they were just better time sinks. If you don't have the time to spend, it is better to go with a less rated course that fits the time you are willing to spend.
