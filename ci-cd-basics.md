# CI/CD Basics

Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery are super important. They automate the building and releasing the software. Automation is great because it saves developer time and it reduces human error.

Tests, code quality gates, vulnerability checks and a lot of other things are done for free by the machine executing these scripts.

There are often release teams who manage a lot of the pipelines that run the CI/CD, but despite that when you are a senior developer you must be able to build them.

Right now, as an aspiring mid level developer you don't need to be able to build them, but you should understand what they do, why they are useful and ideally what steps should be executed in them.

Build your understanding and then test yourself by making a few mock bash scripts that will act as what the agents should execute on trigger for CI or CD.

Become a power user of your editor Your editor is something you spend a lot of time working with. It is the same as hammer to blacksmith and katana to samurai. It's important you are productive with it, since that will save you a lot of time, therefore making you more productive.

My first advice is - don't get lost spending weeks tweaking with your editor. I've done it and it's fun, but you can cheaply become a power user by using widely adopted plugins.

The bare minimum you should have is:

* Code Formatter (when to put space, what type of brackets)
* Autocomplete
* Code Critic (prefer constants over variables where possible)
* build in documentation for the standard library (though most editors support it out of the box)

The idea is to make your editor work for you - concretely to help you save time by doing parts of the mundane tasks that gives you more bandwidth to focus on the business problem.
