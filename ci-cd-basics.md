# CI/CD Basics

Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery are super important. They automate the software building and releasing process. Automation is great because it saves developer time and it reduces human error. Tests, code quality gates, vulnerability checks and a lot of other things are done for free by the machine executing these scripts.

There are often release teams who manage a lot of the pipelines that run the CI/CD, but despite that, when you are a senior developer, you must be able to build them. Right now, as an aspiring mid-level developer, you don't have to be able to build them, but you should understand what they do, their usefulness and, ideally, what steps they should execute.

Build your understanding, and then test yourself by making a few mock bash scripts that will act as what the agents should execute on trigger for CI or CD.

Become a power user of your editor. Your editor is something you spend a lot of time working with. It is the same as a hammer to a blacksmith or a katana to a samurai. You must be productive with it and it will save you a lot of time, making you more productive.

My first advice is - don't get lost spending weeks tweaking your editor. I've done it, and it's fun, but you can cheaply become a power user using widely adopted plugins.

The bare minimum you should have is:

* Code Formatter (where to put a space, which type of brackets, etc.)
* Autocomplete
* Code Critic (prefer constants over variables where possible, etc.)
* Built-in documentation for the standard library (most editors support it out of the box, though)

The idea is to make your editor work for you - specifically to help you save time by doing parts of the mundane tasks and give you more bandwidth to focus on the business problem.
